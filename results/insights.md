# Operational Insights & Recommendations

## Key Findings

1. **Delivery performance is uneven across warehouses**
   - One warehouse concentrates a disproportionate share of delayed orders.
   - Although some centers have fewer delays, their average delay duration is higher,
     indicating more severe operational issues.

2. **A small number of delay reasons explain most delays**
   - The Pareto analysis shows that the top 2–3 delay reasons account for the majority
     of late deliveries.
   - This suggests that targeted improvements could generate significant impact.

3. **Longer processing times are associated with delivery delays**
   - Orders with higher processing time are significantly more likely to miss the
     promised delivery date.
   - This points to internal bottlenecks rather than external demand issues.

## Recommendations

1. **Focus improvement efforts on the worst-performing warehouse**
   - Prioritize process reviews and resource allocation in this location.
   - Short-term actions may include staffing adjustments or workflow optimization.

2. **Address top delay causes first**
   - Create specific action plans for the main delay reasons identified
     (e.g., inventory availability, picking inefficiencies).
   - Monitoring these causes weekly could quickly improve SLA compliance.

3. **Monitor processing time as a leading indicator**
   - Use average processing time as an early warning metric for future delays.
   - Establish threshold alerts to trigger operational interventions.

## Business Impact

- Improving on-time delivery by 5–10% could significantly enhance customer satisfaction.
- Reducing average processing time would directly improve SLA compliance and operational efficiency.





# Operational Insights

## Executive Summary
Brief overview of the main findings and operational risks identified.

## Key Insights

### 1. Service Level Performance
- On-time delivery shows volatility across months.
- Performance degrades during high-volume periods, suggesting capacity constraints.

### 2. Operational Efficiency
- Average process time has an upward trend in certain warehouses.
- One warehouse consistently shows higher processing times than peers.

### 3. Backlog & Demand
- Open orders increase in specific months, indicating backlog accumulation.
- Delivered rate does not fully absorb incoming demand during peak periods.

### 4. Delay Drivers
- Warehouse backlog and carrier delays are the most frequent delay reasons.
- Delay reasons vary by month, pointing to seasonal and structural causes.

## Recommendations
- Reassess capacity planning during peak months.
- Prioritize process improvements in underperforming warehouses.
- Investigate carrier performance during high-delay periods.
